This was a fun code-golfing project that I worked on in February of 
2021. The goal was to make a version of tic-tac-toe that automatically 
checked for wins, and was compacted into a file-size as small as 
possible. What made this different was the language (or script, rather)
that was being used. The Windows CMD script has some quite interesting 
features such as the following mechanic:
<p>

    set var=echo Hello,
    <br>
    %var% world!

<p>
Output:
<br>
Hello, world!
<p>
In this script, variables are updated in runtime and are handled as if 
plain-text. This is what made the Windows cmd script ideal for this project. 
It allowed me to save a few bytes by shrinking commonly-used phrases into 
variables with short names, such as %a%, %b%, %c%, etc...
<p>
The final size ended up being 457 bytes when compressed, which is small 
enough to fit on a version-10 QR code with room to spare.
<p>
As far as I am aware, this is the most compact version of Tic-Tac-Toe 
that exists. Considering that 
<a class="link" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/BootChess" target="_self">BootChess</a>
is only 30 bytes larger, there is undoubtedly room for improvement using 
some other language or script.
